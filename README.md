# Hey! I'm Red.

Amateur / hobbyist software developer. Self-taught BASIC, HTML, Javascript, and Visual Basic in the mid 90s and then took an almost 20 year break from coding while I was in the military. After retiring, I completed an online web dev undergrad program in 2023 and now I'm just vibe coding, making custom iPad games for my kids, and turning my old spreadsheets into web apps.

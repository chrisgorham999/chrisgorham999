# Hey! I'm Chris.

Amateur / hobbyist software developer. Self-taught BASIC in 1995, HTML/Javascript/VB in 1996, and then took an almost 20 year break from coding while I was in the military. Completed the Bellevue University Web Dev undergrad program in 2023 and now I'm just tinkering with things, vibe coding, and turning my old spreadsheets into apps.
